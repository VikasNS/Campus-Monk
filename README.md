# Campus-Monk

CampusMonk is an Educational android app built for the students of RIT(Ramaiah Institute of Technology) to change the way they consume Educational content by providing One step access to Educational content.

My role was to manage the team and to build the Android app.
This project helped me to improve my communicational and team management skills.
This project also helped me to get a good idea of the possible obstacles one might face and how to overcome those starting from development to product release.

Our app helped more than 4000 students with quick access to educational content.
